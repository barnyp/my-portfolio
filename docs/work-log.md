### Code Changes

No code changes were made during this session. The focus was on documentation and analysis of the existing codebase.

### Next Steps

1. Consider implementing Portfolio section which is currently commented out in `src/app/page.tsx`
2. Review and potentially enhance blog post functionality
3. Consider implementing automated tests for key components and API routes
4. Review performance optimization opportunities, especially for image loading

## Session: 2025-06-27 (Part 2)

### Current Goals

Implement improvements identified in lessons-learned.md document, focusing on code quality, type safety, and automated testing.

### Tasks Performed - Code Quality

1. **Fixed Markdown Linting Issues**
   - Updated all documentation files to fix heading and list formatting issues
   - Moved Context7 tags below H1 headings to comply with MD041 rule
   - Added spacing around headings, lists and code blocks

2. **Consolidated Duplicate Files**
   - Identified duplicate file `posts 2.ts` which was identical to `posts.ts`
   - Recommended removal of the duplicate to maintain clean codebase

3. **Enhanced TypeScript Type Safety**
   - Added explicit interfaces and return types to key components:

   ```typescript
   // Contact component interfaces
   interface ContactFormData {
     name: string;
     email: string;
     subject: string;
     message: string;
   }

   interface ContactInfo {
     icon: LucideIcon;
     title: string;
     content: string;
     href: string;
   }

   type StatusType = "" | "Sending..." | "success" | "error" | "CAPTCHA not ready";
   ```

   - Added return type annotations to component functions:

   ```typescript
   export default function Contact(): JSX.Element {
     // Component implementation
   }

   const handleSubmit = async (e: React.FormEvent): Promise<void> => {
     // Function implementation
   };
   ```

4. **Implemented Testing Infrastructure**
   - Fixed dependency issue with `@types/nodemailer`
   - Set up Jest and React Testing Library with configuration files:

   ```javascript
   // jest.config.js
   const nextJest = require('next/jest');
   
   const createJestConfig = nextJest({
     dir: './',
   });
   
   const customJestConfig = {
     setupFilesAfterEnv: ['<rootDir>/jest.setup.js'],
     testEnvironment: 'jest-environment-jsdom',
     // Additional configuration...
   };
   ```

5. **Implemented Component and API Tests**
   - Created test suite for Contact component
   - Created test suite for Contact API endpoint
   - Added test scripts to package.json:

   ```json
   "scripts": {
     "test": "jest",
     "test:watch": "jest --watch"
   }
   ```

### Implementation Details

Key modules and functions modified:

1. Enhanced Type Safety in `src/components/sections/Contact.tsx`
2. Enhanced Type Safety in `src/components/sections/Hero.tsx`
3. Added test configurations in root directory
4. Added component tests in `src/components/sections/__tests__/Contact.test.tsx`
5. Added API tests in `src/app/api/contact/__tests__/route.test.ts`
6. Fixed Markdown linting issues in documentation files

### Testing Progress and Notes

1. Resolve test failures in Contact component tests:
   - The tests are encountering React act() errors which typically occur when state updates happen outside of act() calls
   - Consider using more advanced mocking for React context and hooks in the test environment
   - May need to refactor the Contact component to be more testable by extracting side effects

2. Fix API tests for the contact endpoint:
   - Current issues with mocking the Next.js Request/Response objects
   - May require a more sophisticated mock implementation or actual integration tests

3. Implement additional tests for other key components once the testing framework issues are resolved

4. Consider adding end-to-end tests with tools like Cypress or Playwright as an alternative

5. Continue enhancing type safety in other components

## Session: 2025-06-27 (Part 3)

### Current Goals - Testing

Implement unit tests for Hero and Blog components and scaffold E2E tests with Playwright for critical user flows.

### Tasks Performed - Testing Implementation

1. **Fixed React act() Warnings in Tests**
   - Added global mocks in `jest.setup.js` for `framer-motion` and `react-google-recaptcha-v3`:

   ```javascript
   // jest.setup.js
   jest.mock('framer-motion', () => ({
     motion: {
       div: ({ children, ...props }) => <div {...props}>{children}</div>,
       // Other elements mocked similarly
     },
     AnimatePresence: ({ children }) => <>{children}</>,
   }));

   jest.mock('react-google-recaptcha-v3', () => ({
     useGoogleReCaptcha: () => ({
       executeRecaptcha: jest.fn().mockResolvedValue('test-token'),
     }),
     GoogleReCaptchaProvider: ({ children }) => <>{children}</>,
   }));
   ```

2. **Implemented Hero Component Test**
   - Created basic unit test verifying Hero component renders correctly
   - Verified heading and CTA button are present

3. **Implemented Blog Component Test**
   - Created unit test for BlogClient component with mock posts
   - Added snapshot test to detect regression issues

4. **Scaffolded Playwright E2E Tests**
   - Installed Playwright and configured `playwright.config.ts`:

   ```typescript
   // playwright.config.ts
   import { defineConfig } from '@playwright/test';

   export default defineConfig({
     testDir: './e2e',
     webServer: {
       command: 'npm run dev',
       url: 'http://localhost:3000',
       reuseExistingServer: !process.env.CI,
     },
     use: {
       baseURL: 'http://localhost:3000',
     },
   });
   ```

5. **Implemented Contact Form E2E Test**
   - Created E2E test for Contact form interaction
   - Successfully verified form field interactions
   - Encountered limitations with API submission testing

### Implementation Details

1. **E2E Test Limitations**
   - The Contact form E2E test was limited to form field interaction verification
   - API submission testing was challenging due to:
     - reCAPTCHA integration blocking form submission in test environment
     - Difficulties mocking the API response in the Playwright environment
   - Simplified test to focus on form field interaction rather than full submission flow

   ```typescript
   // e2e/contact-form.spec.ts
   test('should fill out contact form', async ({ page }) => {
     await page.goto('/contact');
     await page.waitForSelector('form');
     
     // Fill out the form
     await page.fill('input[name="name"]', 'Test User');
     await page.fill('input[name="email"]', 'test@example.com');
     await page.fill('input[name="subject"]', 'E2E Test');
     await page.fill('textarea[name="message"]', 'This is an automated E2E test message.');
     
     // Verify form inputs have correct values
     await expect(page.locator('input[name="name"]')).toHaveValue('Test User');
     // Additional assertions...
   });
   ```

### Future Tasks

1. Complete test implementation:
   - Enhance E2E tests to handle reCAPTCHA and API mocking properly
   - Consider server-side API testing as an alternative to E2E API testing
   - Implement E2E tests for blog navigation and other critical user flows

2. Additional type safety enhancements:
   - Implement explicit interfaces for remaining components
   - Add strict typing for shared utility functions
   - Consider using more advanced TypeScript features like conditional types and mapped types

3. Performance optimizations:
   - Audit and optimize image loading
   - Implement code splitting for large components
   - Consider server components for data-heavy sections
